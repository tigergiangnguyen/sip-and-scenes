## About This Project:
Sip & Scenes is a website that asks the user to pick their desired genre of a movie/TV-show and then displays three movies or shows and two drink options that match said genre. The user starts off on the landing page and once the genre is clicked, they are then referred to the results page to see their movie/show and drink selections. To do this, we used two third party API's named TheCocktailDB and RapidAPI to use as libraries for both the movie and drink options. We also used Tailwind as the CSS framework and jQuery as a library to help write the JavaScript code. 


## Made With:
- HTML
- CSS
