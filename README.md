## About This Project:
Sip & Scenes is a website that asks the user to pick their desired genre of a movie and then displays three movies and two drink options that match the genre. The user starts off on the landing page and once the genre is clicked, they are then referred to the results page to see their movie and drink selections. To do this, we used two third party API's named TheCocktailDB and OMDb to use as libraries for both the movie and drink options. We also used Tailwind as the CSS framework and jQuery as another API to help write the functions.
